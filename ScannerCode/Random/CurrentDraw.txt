Wall Power Measurement:
	Measurement device Error: 

Idle Max:
0.349 A

X Axis Max:
0.76 A
Note: adding resistance adds a little bit of current draw. Thus, always have some overhead

Y Axis Max:
0.688

Z Axis Max:
0.679
Not: b/c current is dpendant on weight of load, this one might be affected the most by future attachments

X, Y, and Z Axis Max:
0.924 A

Easy to conclude that current draw is not linear. I think a power supply with 2 or 3 A of power delivery should be plenty.
