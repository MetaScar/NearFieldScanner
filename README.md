Code related to or used by Professor Scarborough's Planar Near-Field Scanner. Majority of design and code created by Jacob Stewart. To communicate with a Keysight VNA, the code located in the "instrument" folder was created by Pual Flaten and Joel Johnson. Thank you for the code nerds!

# Quickstart
This quickstart guide is assuming you are trying to run the near-field scanner. There is other code included in this repo that is used for just post processing the data. Hopefully, in a future version of the code, all post processing can be completed within the Matlab app. 

1. Pull the git repo with desired method (using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/), the [terminal](https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull), etc.).
2. Go into the `ScannerCode` directory.
3. [Start Matlab][^1].
