# Overview

Welcome to the low cost planar near-field scanner repo! 
The goal of this repo is to contain everything you will need to build your own near-field scanner.
Everything in this repo is open source under the Apache 2 license. Feel free to modify as needed, but reference this repo.

Instructions for how to build the near-field scanner are not yet complete. 
However, all the required parts for building the near-field scanner should be listed or an stl file provided to allow the user to 3D print their own parts.
Details on manufacturing these parts are not yet provided.
